This project is an academic project developed for a class of cloud technologies

key technologies : Node.js , express, Angular JS, HTML 5, Mongodb over Mongo Labs

Key features of this project were :
 
 1) To develop an multiTenant application where UI workflows are independent of number of tenants and fields.
 2) Model in the client side is directly populated by model on server side. 
 3) Configuration of Model is independent of model instanciation thus making it scalable at tenant level and application level.
 4) The application uses Mean stack extensively over Cloud thus making it performance wise scalable as well.
